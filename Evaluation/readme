As the 'Rated Candidates' folder contain test groups with similarities and feature distances already computed, 
this folder serves the following purposes:
    1) calculating final similarity score for each combination of the algorithm (all, lab, and fea)
    2) rank candidates by the final score
    3) calculate nDCG scores at each position (10 positions in total) for evaluation.
